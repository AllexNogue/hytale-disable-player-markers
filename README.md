# hytale-disable-player-markers
A lightweight and focused Hytale server plugin that disables player map markers, preventing players from tracking each other through the map.

This plugin is designed for PvP, anarchy and hardcore servers, where exploration, positioning and awareness should come from gameplay — not from the map UI.

Only player markers are affected.
All other map elements and markers remain untouched.

## 🔮 Planned Features (Future Roadmap)

This project is actively evolving. Planned features include:

Clan system

Ally visibility: players will be able to see map markers only for allied clan members

Commands to manage clans and alliances

Optional configuration per world or ruleset

The goal is to keep the map clean and fair, while still allowing organized group play through alliances.

## 🎯 Ideal for

PvP-focused servers

Anarchy servers

Hardcore survival gameplay

Servers that want to reduce map-based player tracking
